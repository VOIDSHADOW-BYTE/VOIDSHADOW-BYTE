# Hi there! I'm void 👋

I'm just getting started on my coding journey, with a strong interest in **Full-Stack Development**. Right now, I'm laying the groundwork by learning **C Language**, which is helping me build a solid understanding of programming fundamentals.

### 🛠 What I'm Currently Learning:
- **C Programming**: Gaining knowledge of essential programming concepts like data types, loops, and memory management.
- Focusing on problem-solving skills and getting comfortable with how things work under the hood.

### 🎯 My Goals:
- Eventually dive into **Full-Stack Development**, where I can build both front-end and back-end applications.
- Learn technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Node.js** to start creating web apps.
  
### 🤝 Let's Connect:
As I continue learning, I’m always open to advice, collaboration, and sharing experiences with other beginners and developers. Stay tuned for projects as I move forward in my coding journey!

Thanks for stopping by!
